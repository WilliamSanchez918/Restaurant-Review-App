## Origin
This project was built from Udacity Starter code for the Resutaurant Reviews App

## RunMe

src: https://github.com/WilliamSanchez918/Restaurant-Review-App

1. Clone/Download the Repo [$ git clone src]
2. Ensure you have a local webserver (Python is avaliable natively on most systems)

* In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

* With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.


## API

Google Map API is utilized for location services for restaurants lat/long data

## ES6
Most of the code in this project has been written to the ES6 JavaScript specification for compatibility with modern web browsers and future-proofing JavaScript code. As much as possible, try to maintain use of ES6 in any additional JavaScript you write.
